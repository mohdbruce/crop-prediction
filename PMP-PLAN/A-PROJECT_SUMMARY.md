# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary

Crop Yield Prediction is a technique that employs data science to anticipate the potential yield of a crop based on a variety of parameters such as weather, soil quality, and crop type. This entails gathering data from numerous sources, developing a predictive model with machine learning techniques, and utilising the model to anticipate future crop yields based on present and projected circumstances.

Furthermore,crop yield prediction can assist farmers in more efficiently managing resources like as water, fertilisers, and pesticides, decreasing the environmental impact of agriculture and encouraging sustainability. Yield crop prediction can serve to support local economies and create job possibilities in rural regions by enhancing the profitability of farming operations. Finally, yield crop prediction in data science projects may serve to increase the quality and amount of food provided, encourage sustainable farming practises, and help communities' economic and social well-being.
