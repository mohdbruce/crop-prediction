# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

## Method:

we use decision tree algorithm as our method where we used for both classification and regression of the crop. The decision tree algorithm is a type of supervised learning algorithm that works by recursively partitioning the input data into subsets based on the values of the input features, until a stopping criterion is met. The result then can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

since we want to make the prediction for the yield of the crop with the temperature, rainfall and pesticides as the feature. The decison tree algorithm can then be used to predict the crop yield for a given feature. Then, the resulting decision tree can provide insights into the most important factors that influence crop yields and can help farmers optimize their crop management practices for better yields.

## Steps:

#### Data Collection:
Data on crop yields being collected and detailed reaserch being made.

#### Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data is preprocessed by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

#### Feature Selection: 
We use all the feature from the dataset since we all the feature in the dataset is important to achieve our objective.

#### Training and validation: 
The decision tree algorithm is trained on the selected features using the train dataset that being split, while the rest of the data is used for validation using the test dataset. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on metrics such as mean absolute error or R-squared.

#### Testing: 
Once the algorithm is trained and tested, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
