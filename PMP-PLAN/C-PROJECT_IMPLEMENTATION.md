# Implementation

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN

### Deliverables:

#### Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware we used our laptop which is consists of intel core I5 8th Gen + 4GB RAM + SSD to implement our project.


#### Software Requirement:
For the software, we used Jupiter platform to code the python program for the AI module which is predicting the yield crop prediction and displaying the output. The database we used is took from UCI machine learning repository which is the Kaggle Dataset.

### Dataset:

  The dataset we use is crop yield dataset that have a collection of data related to the amount of crops produced in a given area of land over a certain period of time. These datasets include information about the type of crops grown, the geographic location of the crops, and the yield produced per unit of land. We use the dataset to make the analytic and research to help farmers and reasercher to make informed decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and food security.
  
  The dataset contains crop:
  
+ Maize
+ Plantains and others
+ Potatoes
+ Rice, paddy
+ Sorghum
+ Soybeans
+ Sweet potatoes
+ Wheat
+ Yams


 The dataset cover each part of the world, it it good since we can see all the crop that being observe with a different environment on different country. It is also contains the climatic factors include rainfall and temperature in each country from year 1961 to 2016. The dataset contains the crops yields production value with hg/ha as the unit.
