# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## E. COMPLETING THE PROJECT

####  Final Project Report
**CROP YIELDS PREDICTION**

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES** <br>
The crop yield prediction was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect the crop yield from the data and also predict the importances of feature that effect the yield with more accuracy.

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS** <br>
After the crop yield prediction completed, we have tested the accuracy of the system which is more than 61%.

**3.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**3.1 SCOPE** <br>
The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system is not able to detect complex crop yield prediction. The project also scope down the limit of only crop yield detection.

**3.2 OBJECTIVES** <br>
The objective of a project focused at improving mankind is to use the power of data science to address significant societal concerns. Data scientists may assist to uncover novel solutions to challenges such as food shortages, climate change, and social inequity by applying sophisticated analytics to a variety of issues. The project intends to provide a variety of prediction models, algorithms, and tools to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions and taking proactive measures to solve these difficulties. In particular, the project intends to construct accurate and reliable models that can anticipate crop yields and identify characteristics that contribute to successful farming in the context of yield crop prediction. The initiative seeks to improve food security, promote sustainable agriculture, and assist local populations by enhancing crop yield and minimising waste. The project's ultimate purpose is to use data science to address urgent social and environmental concerns and improve humanity's well-being.

**3.3 IMPACTS** <br>
The project's influence on mankind aims to employ data science to address critical societal concerns such as food shortage, climate change, and social inequity. The project can improve food security, promote sustainable agriculture, and benefit local people by building accurate and trustworthy models that can anticipate crop yields and identify factors that contribute to successful farming. Finally, the initiative has the potential to improve humanity's well-being by utilising data science to address urgent social and environmental concerns.

**3.4 TRANSITION PLAN** <br>
+ Engage with key stakeholders, including farmers, agricultural organizations, and local communities, to gather feedback and ensure that the project is aligned with their needs and priorities.
+ Develop a strategy for scaling up the project's impact, including expanding the scope of the project to other regions, crops, and stakeholders.
+ Continuously monitor and evaluate the project's impact, and adjust strategies and approaches as needed to ensure that the project is achieving its goals and making a meaningful difference in the lives of people and communities.
