# Crop Yield Prediction

Based on 17 sustainable goals, we are focussing on Goal 15: Life of Land.

In this project, we have build Crop Yield Prediction in predicting size of yield based on average temperature and average rainfall per year. 

To make this project becomes successful, we have used:
-Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset?resource=download)
 
 -Specific csv file: yield_df.csv


-Google Colab for Python language
